# ESP32-LED

## Description 
The ESP32 microcontroller is employed in conjunction with four LEDs to establish a responsive system. When the ESP32 successfully retrieves the appropriate data from an HTML page, it triggers the illumination of the LEDs. The LEDs are specifically designated for indicating left, backward, right, stop and forward movements.
